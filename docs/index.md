Some of you recognize this snippet of code, and others might not. It's a classic example of a program in an *esoteric* language. (In this particular case, Brainfuck).

In the below series of pages, I'll be walking you through creating your own interpreter, for the language `REDACTED` (will be visible at the end, those curious enough can look it up anyway based on the description).

Each week, a series of assignments are provided. Complete these in order, and at the end you will be able to understand the following snippet:

## Note for CoL #tech-club viewers

You can earn points for this for quite a while. I'll tally them up at the end of the weeks, and later decide how I want to give out bonuses. Note: implementations for this interpreter taken from some online resource will not reward you with any points, as it defeats the entire purpose.
